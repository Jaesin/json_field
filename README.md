# Installation

You need ideally the jsonview client library from
https://github.com/yesmeck/jquery-jsonview/releases. Put the latest release into
our sites/all/libraries folder so the folder structure looks like the following:

```
- libraries
 \- jsonview
   \- dist
     \- jquery.jsonview.css
     \- jquery.jsonview.js
```
